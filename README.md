# pipelineforce

# Description
In this project, the entire batch worked as a team on a greenfield project designed to create an extensible CI/CD pipeline. Since this isn't a program you can boot up, I've included the documentation we created regarding the pipeline.

# My Role
I was one of four team leads. I led a team of engineers to install, deploy, and configure Spinnaker on the EKS cluster. We were also tasked with using Spinnaker to implement blue/green deployments onto the Kubernetes cluster. Due to the nature of my team's role, we do not have much code to include. I have included some example .yaml files that were used in the deployment of Spinnaker along with a barebones example of a Spinnaker pipeline as code. I have also included the documentation that we created with regards to the Spinnaker team's work (located in the "SupportDocs" directory).
