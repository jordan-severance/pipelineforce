Description:
In this project, the entire batch worked as a team on a greenfield project designed to create an extensible CI/CD pipeline. 

My Role:
I was one of four team leads. I led a team of engineers to install, deploy, and configure Spinnaker on the EKS cluster. We were also tasked with using Spinnaker to implement blue/green deployments onto the Kubernetes cluster.
